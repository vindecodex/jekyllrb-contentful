  qoutes: Lorem ipsum, or lipsum as it is sometimes known, is dummy text used in laying
    out print, graphic or web designs. The passage is attributed to an unknown typesetter
    in the 15th century who is thought to have scrambled parts of Cicero's De Finibus
    Bonorum et Malorum for use in a type specimen book.

  qoutes: Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has
    roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000
    years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in
    Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem
    Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature,
    discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and
    1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by
    Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very
    popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor
    sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
